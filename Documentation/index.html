         <p>YouTube has become the biggest and most popular platform for sharing video content online. It’s also a great way for people to express their creativity, make some extra money, promote themselves or their business, and possibly even become a massive “Internet famous” celebrity.</p>
        <p>If you’re considering becoming an official YouTuber, there are several things you will need to prepare—the most important being your essential video equipment.</p>
        <p>Creating quality videos is not as easy as it looks. Luckily, you don’t need to have a lot of technical know-how to produce the kind of content that people will enjoy watching—you simply need the right equipment.</p>
        <p>If you have a great personality and truly unique and amazing content, you could probably get away with using just a smartphone. But do keep in mind that YouTube has become an extremely competitive space, and as a beginner, it’s best to put some effort into the visual quality of your videos to ensure that you get views and gain subscribers.</p>
        <p>Many established YouTubers use a wide array of sophisticated video production equipment (some even hire professional video editors and camera operators) to produce their videos—but you don’t need to go that far. Here is a list of the basic video production equipment you will need to start your YouTube channel:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Camera</li>
          <li>Microphone</li>
          <li>Tripod or Gimbal Stabilizer</li>
          <li>Lighting</li>
          <li>Video Editing Software</li>

         <p>If video isn’t already an important part of your content marketing strategy, odds are it’s about to be. Web content is taking a turn toward video whether SEOs and content marketers like it or not. Nearly 50% of marketers are adding YouTube and Facebook channels for video distribution in the next year; one third of online activity is spent watching video; and video itself is projected to account for more than 80% of all internet traffic by 2019. 80%!</p>
        <p>Not an expert? Don’t know how to edit videos, have a video studio, or have a bona fide video specialist to shoot and cut your features? That’s alright! The goal of today’s blog is to show you that with the right video editing software, you too can churn out sleek, professional video content—regardless of experience—and keep your content strategy ahead of the curve.

        <ol>
          <li>Canva</li>
          <p>Canva is one of the best online graphic design tools on the market today and allows you to create incredible YouTube thumbnails. This tool is very useful to designers and non-designers alike who want to create professional-looking visuals – like YouTube creators who want to make eye-grabbing thumbnails.</p>
          <p>Canva is more than just a thumbnail-maker tool. You can use it for all your graphic design work and take advantage of the more than one-million photos, graphics, templates and fonts it offers. The smooth drag-and-drop interface provides a seamless experience as you upload your images and texts.</p>
          <p>Your thumbnail creation with Canva includes free stock type photos, texts, backgrounds, grids, frames, shapes, lines, and illustrations. Canva is free to use, although it has a few paid elements such as clip art and some stock photos. It also has a mobile app for Android and iOS.</p>
          <li>Fotojet</li>
          <p>Fotojet is another great tool you can use to create spectacular YouTube thumbnails. Unlike most online programs that perform graphic design functions in general, Fotojet pays special attention to YouTube thumbnail design. It also provides photo editing, graphics designing, and collage-making resources. Fotojet has over 500 collage making templates, which makes it a useful resource for creating YouTube graphics such as thumbnails.</p>
          <p>Fotojet features an advanced thumbnail creator tool that allows the user to tweak the images in the most flattering way possible. You can use this tool to add filters, resize, crop, or even rotate your images. It has a simple interface that allows you to create stunning thumbnails without any complications.

          <li>Snappa</li>
          <p>Just like Canva, Snappa is a jack-of-all-trades and allows you to do more than just create YouTube thumbnails. It’s one of the best graphic design tools for non-designers because of its versatility and ease of use. It offers a ton of templates for social media as well as for YouTube thumbnails. All you need is to sign up for a free account and start using some of the pre-made YouTube templates.</p>
          <pre>
  <code>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxzvt2mNXJo</code>
          </pre>
          <p>Snappa also allows you to create YouTube templates from scratch. You can choose to use the available visual icons or upload your own images for your thumbnails. Snappa also gives you limitless options to customize your thumbnails. You can create shapes, add effects, insert custom texts, customize the background and more to make your thumbnails stand out. It has both a free and a paid version.</p>
          
          <li>Adobe Spark</li>
         <p>Adobe Spark promises an easy YouTube thumbnail creation process. This online graphic design tool resembles Canva in many ways and can also be used for multifarious functions. Unlike Canva, Adobe Spark does not charge you to use the pre-made thumbnail layouts. It has a special category for YouTube thumbnails, and this makes the thumbnail creation process simple and straightforward.</p>
          <p>One thing you’ll notice with Adobe Spark is that it lacks the many “ornaments” you’ll find in other thumbnail-maker tools. Its features are pretty basic and on point. However, that doesn’t make it inferior. It lets you add texts, color, background components, and many other basic elements you’ll need to make your thumbnails stand out. Adobe Spark has a free and a paid version. It also has a mobile app for iOS.</p>
          <li>Fotor</li>
          <p>Fotor offers incredible thumbnail creation tools, thanks to its advanced photo-editing features. First, it provides you with eye-catching themes from all over the world that you can use to create thumbnails that will entice people to click your videos.</p>
          <p>Then it provides you with a clean and smooth interface to edit your thumbnails and all the elements you’ll need to add visual appeal to your thumbnails. Fotor is easy to use, so you won’t need expert knowledge to create stunning thumbnails. Besides editing, Fotor is also a great tool for making collages.</p>

     <!-- Personality -->
    <section class="main-section" id="Personality"> 
      <header>Personality</header> 
      <artical>
        <h4>Trait #1</h4>
         <p>There’s a familiar theme among the most successful Youtuber’s and it has to do with being yourself. The audience can see right thru someone who isn’t being genuine and we’ve seen several young creators with massive audiences fall hard lately because it was discovered that they were not who they pretended to be.</p>      
        <h4>Trait #2</h4>
         <p>There is a steady flow of content that airs on a certain day once per week. The magic combo seems to be publishing videos weekly but it’s also about knowing what your people want. For other social platforms like Twitter or Pinterest, more frequent posts might be appropriate. Best practices are all about following the etiquette of that particular network. Do your homework, observe and listen, then jump in the game.</p>      
        <h4>Trait #3</h4>
         <p>They don’t risk it all at first. Fousey described how he got started. He was working at Chili’s putting money in the bank while making videos on the side for cheap. Once one of his videos hit it big, he quit his day job and never looked back but still spends very little on production costs. He does all of the work which includes the writing and editing.</p>      
        <h4>Trait #4</h4>
         <p>They don’t give up. Sometimes Fousey’s videos don’t go viral and that’s okay with him. He creates what he thinks is entertaining content and keeps trying to please his audience. You’re only as good as your last video so you have to keep on going.</p>      
        <h4>Trait #5</h4>
         <p>They care. Author Gary Vaynerchuk wrote in his book, The Thank You Economy, “The person who cares the most wins.” Fousey listens to feedback and tries his best to react to what he thinks will be entertaining for his community. That could include pulling horrible pranks on some of his best friends but it’s always fun to watch.</p>

      <artical>
        <ol>
          <li>Select a video-editing program</li>
         <p>You use the program to edit individual shots into a single video file, which you can then upload to YouTube. The editing program also enables you to add onscreen text, graphics and other special effects.</p>
         <p>While you can buy video editing programs, such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Apple's Final Cut Pro, they can be costly and complicated to use. There are a number of free or low-cost programs that can produce satisfactory results. If you have a Windows PC, you can use Microsoft's free Movie Maker software, and if you're a Mac user, there's Apple's free iMovie. Both programs are fine for basic editing and special effects, and they're surprisingly easy to use.</p>
          <p>If you have more advanced needs, check out such programs as Adobe Premiere Elements, Sony Movie Studio Platinum and Pinnacle Studio, each of which costs $100 or less. These programs offer more choices for transitions and special effects and produce more sophisticated results.</p>
          <li>Edit your production</li>
         <p>Whichever editing program you choose, it can be simple to piece together the individual shots you made into a single video. The goal, of course, is to create a seamless video that effectively tells your story.</p>
         <p>Most editing programs offer a timeline view, onto which you drop the individual shots. Each of your shots is actually a separate video file, and you're adding these video files to the timeline of your master video. You can move the shots around, trim or shorten any individual shot, and delete the shots that aren't working for you. You can then add transitions between shots, such as fades, to give a more professional look to the final production.</p>
          <li>Add text, graphics and other special effects</li>
         <p>Once you've edited together your individual shots into a single video, you can enhance it with special effects. For example, most businesses want to add their website URL or toll-free phone number to the video, which you can do by superimposing that text onscreen. With most editing programs, this can be accomplished by adding a text layer to the video at certain points, typically the beginning and end of the video.</p>
         <p>You also can superimpose pictures and other graphics, perhaps to show a product package while other action is taking place onscreen. Other special effects include split-screen, soft focus and sepia tone. In addition, you can add background music, either your own or generic music styles provided by the editing program. You don't need to be a pro to add these special effects, as most of these programs guide you through these functions step-by-step.</p>
          <p>As tempting as many of these special effects may be, don't go overboard. You don't want onscreen graphics and other fancy effects to draw attention away from your key message. They should help tell your story, not get in the way.</p>
          <li>Choose the right file format.</li>
         <p>When your video editing is complete, you can create a final video file to upload to YouTube and other video-sharing sites. YouTube will accept most major file formats, so you're probably safe no matter which one you choose. I recommend the .AVI, .MP4, or .WMA formats, which are all supported by the major video editing programs.</p>
         <p>When you're editing your video, make sure you're using a 16:9 ratio widescreen format, which viewers generally expect. And whichever file format you choose, render your file in either 720p or 1080i high definition. Even if viewers watch your video in a lower-resolution format on their computer monitors, you want to start with the highest resolution possible in the original file. What's more, some viewers will be watching your video on big-screen, high-definition TVs, so you don't want to feed them a lower-resolution version.</p>
